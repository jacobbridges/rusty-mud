* What is this?

Right now, this is a mess.

The end goal is something like a MUD engine for Discord. Althought I
suspect the project will go stale around the time I get a demo
running..

* How to run this?

Right now there's not much. A quick ~cargo run~ will start the game
loop and ask accept user input from the console. Nothing has been
linked up to Discord yet, or networking in general. See my TODO list
later in this document.

* Ideas

- Each player can battle through the Story Train via DM with the bot,
  but when they reach Story Lord they unlock the boss battle room in
  the Discord server where they get to fight Story Lord alongside any
  other players who have made it to the final boss.
- Each player begins with only one class option. Something basic like
  warrior. More class options are unlocked by events during
  gameplay. For example, killing an assassin would unlock the assassin
  class. Or killing a wizard, picking up his spellbook, and attempting
  to read it would unlock the wizard class.
