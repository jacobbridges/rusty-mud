* What is this?

Right now, this is a mess.

The end goal is something like a MUD engine for Discord. Althought I
suspect the project will go stale around the time I get a demo
running..

* How to run this?

Right now there's not much. A quick ~cargo run~ will start the game
loop and ask accept user input from the console. Nothing has been
linked up to Discord yet, or networking in general. See my TODO list
later in this document.

* TODOS

** TODO Networking [0/4]
- [ ] Communication for a game is dedicated to a channel.
- [ ] Input is received from channel.
- [ ] Output is written to channel.
- [ ] Player is associated to channel.
** TODO Combat [1/6]
- [ ] Entities which can be targeted for damage
- [ ] Component to track entity health
- [X] Game states (see [[https://github.com/amethyst/rustrogueliketutorial/blob/d6a4673ca59cffe057d4b0015b4920ecd5faa3b6/chapter-09-items/src/main.rs#L61-L139][this example in github]])

** TODO Inventory [0/0]
** TODO Equipment [0/0]
** TODO Menus [0/0]
** TODO Player Customization [0/0]

* Ideas

- Each player can battle through the Story Train via DM with the bot,
  but when they reach Story Lord they unlock the boss battle room in
  the Discord server where they get to fight Story Lord alongside any
  other players who have made it to the final boss.
